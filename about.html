          <h1>About Creator Central</h1>
          <p>
            Creator Central was created to be a unique space where creators can
            interact with fans on a more personal level.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Creators are able to apply for their own creator page. If accepted
            they are able to make a customizable page where they can post
            updates, blog post, videos, and many other things to interact with
            their fans. In addition, they have the option to create a free page
            or private paid subscription based page.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Fans/supporters can follow or subscribe to their favorite content
            creators. If enabled by the creator fans are also able to send
            private messages to their favorite creators. By following a creator
            you are given access to a more personal and private experience,
            allowing for them to get to know you more closely.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the most exciting things about creator central is how it
            serves both the fans and the creators in a better way. By allowing
            creators to better monitize their platform they are able to focus
            more on delivering content to their most loyal fans. And for their
            supporters they are given more exclusive access and can connect more
            personally with their favorite content creators.
