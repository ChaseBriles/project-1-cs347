    <p>
      I am very happy with how my project turned out. I think I was able to make
      a great site that can easily be scaled to add on the real features a site
      like mine would have.
      <br />

    <ol>
      <li>
        The site has a clear and focused theme - a patreon like service where
        creators can post.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of the content is written by myself - and the pictures we taken from
        a free stock photo website.
      </li>
      <li>
        My site contains 5 seperate pages: Home, About, Creators, News, and
        Apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a header which contains the required navigation links to the
        different pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        The style is consistent across all pages, and is somewhat
        responsive...having a tough time with the header.
      </li>
      <li>
        All images have an appropriate alt description - and all pages have a
        favicon declared
      </li>
      <li>
        All styles are located in a CSS folder, all images are located in the
        proper images folder.
      </li>
      <li>Attempting to go to HTTP reroutes to HTTPS</li>
      <li>All class and id names are in kebab-case</li>
      <li>My git repo has been shared with Dr. Stewart</li>
      <li>All files are lower case and alphanumeric</li>
      <li>Git repo shows a steady flow of commits</li>
      <li>
        My website contains two animations - one for the nav links - and one for
        loading the news page.
      </li>
